# Plot

This is a game where you, a fox, shoot cherries at bugs (the balloons) flying around your house (because you hate them).
Avoid pesky vultures too, they're annoying.

While the name of the game seems uninspiring, the game itself is quite literally infested with bugs.

If anything, it's actually a poetic commentary. Not even I expected that.
